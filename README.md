# Sea Monster Crowdfunding – CodePath WEB102 Prework

This project simulates a crowdfunding platform for independent games. The site dynamically displays game data, filters content, and summarizes funding statistics using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

---

## ✅ Project Goals

- Practice JavaScript fundamentals like loops, functions, `reduce`, `filter`, and event listeners.
- Manipulate the DOM to dynamically render content.
- Implement UI interactivity with filtering and sorting.

---

## 📋 Completed Challenges

### 🔹 Challenge 3: Render All Games
- Dynamically loads all games from `GAMES_JSON`.
- Each game is displayed with its image, title, description, and number of backers.
- Built using `document.createElement`, `innerHTML`, and `appendChild`.

### 🔹 Challenge 4: Summary Statistics
- Shows:
  - Total number of contributions (backers)
  - Total amount raised
  - Total number of games
- Used `reduce()` to calculate values and `toLocaleString()` for formatting numbers with commas.

### 🔹 Challenge 5: Filter Buttons
- Buttons to:
  - Show all games
  - Show only funded games
  - Show only unfunded games
- Used `filter()` to build new arrays based on funding status.
- Used `addEventListener()` to hook up the buttons.

### 🔹 Challenge 6: Company Summary Paragraph
- Added a summary `<p>` element inside the `#description-container`.
- Describes:
  - Total raised
  - Number of games
  - Number of unfunded games (using ternary operator for grammar)
- Built with `createElement`, template literals, and DOM insertion.

### 🔹 Challenge 7: Top Funded Games
- Sorted games by pledged amount using `.sort()`.
- Used destructuring to extract the top two games:  
  `const [topGame, secondGame, ...rest] = sortedGames`
- Displayed top game names in `#first-game` and `#second-game` containers.

## 🧪 Testing & Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Confirm:
   - Game cards load correctly.
   - Stats appear at the top.
   - Filter buttons work as expected.
   - Summary paragraph is displayed.
   - Top 2 funded games are shown.
